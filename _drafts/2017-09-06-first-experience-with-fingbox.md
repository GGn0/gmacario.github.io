I just received my [Fingbox](https://www.fing.io/fingbox/)
device as a reward for [my pledge on Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/fingbox-network-security-wi-fi-troubleshooting/x/7852060#/) on December 2016.
This post describes my first experiences with it.
The devices comes packaged in a nice 13.5 cm cube. After opening the package, I followed the three steps of the quick setup guide contained inside.
### Preparing my Fingbox
A few seconds after powering it up, the green LED of the Fingbox is turned on.
### Control it from the Fing App
The "Fing" app is available on Apple App Store as well as Google Play.
As I had already installed the Fing app on my Android phone (Samsung Galaxy S6e), I simply started it, then tapped the "Fingbox" icon until my new Fingbox was detected.
At this point my Fingbox turned blue.
