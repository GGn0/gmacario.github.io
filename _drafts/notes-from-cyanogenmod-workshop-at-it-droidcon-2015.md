# Notes from CyanogenMod Workshop at IT Droidcon 2015

Here are a few notes which I took when attending the
[Cyanogen Workshop](http://it.droidcon.com/2015/sessions/cyanogen-workshop/)
during the [IT Droidcon 2015](http://it.droidcon.com/2015/) which took place in Torino on 2015-04-10.

The workshop was led by [Abhisek Devkota](https://twitter.com/ciwrl), Senior Engineering and Community Manager at Cyanogen Inc., who was extremely good in driving the workshop forward and answered a lot of questions from the audience.

### Preparing the development environment

Due to some issues in the VPS that was provided to the participants
I used one machine which I had available - that had the additional benefit
to make sure I could reproduce all the steps - including provisioning the build environment!

I had a Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit server available via SSH with Docker installed.

After logging in to the server, I cloned the "docker-cyanogenmod" project

    $ git clone https://github.com/gmacario/docker-cyanogenmod.git -b test-droidcon

Note: the "test-droidcon" branch on my fork is used in order to install
exactly the packages which Abhisek had installed in his VPS instances.

Then run the following commands to create a Docker container with all the needed software automagically installed:

    $ cd docker-cyanogenmod
    $ ./run.sh

The first time it will take a few minutes to create the Docker image
and start the container, but subsequent runs will be much faster!

As a result I eventually got a shell inside the container:

Wow, plenty of resources to use! Let's move on...

### Installing Repo

Logged as cmbuild@container:

    $ mkdir -p ~/bin
    $ curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
    $ chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

### Installing the Android SDK

Download the latest version of the Android SDK for Linux (24.1.2 as of 2015-04-10)

    $ mkdir -p ~/sdk
    $ cd ~/sdk
    $ curl -O http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r24.1.2-linux.tgz

If the previous fails for whatever reasons (i.e. you are in a location which blocks access to Google)

    $ curl -O https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2834459/android-sdk_r24.1.2-linux.tgz

After extracting the file your may remove the install tarball to save space:

    $ tar zxvf android-sdk_r24.1.2-linux.tgz
    $ rm android-sdk_r24.1.2-linux.tgz

Update `~/.bashrc` with the following definitions:

```
$ cat <<END >>~/.bashrc
export ANDROID_HOME="\$HOME/sdk/android-sdk-linux"
export PATH="\$ANDROID_HOME/tools:\$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:\$PATH"
END
```

Then logout from the container and launch `./run.sh` again to make sure
the environment variables are set correctly.

### Using the Android SDK

You should have the `android` command in PATH, therefore you may do the following:

Get help

    $ android --help

List remote SDK repository

    $ android list sdk

Update the SDK specified

    $ android update sdk --no-ui --filter 1,2,5

You must read and accept the license by typing "y", then the download will start.


### Git config and repo init

```
$ git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
$ git config --global user.name "First Lastname"
$ git config --global color.ui auto
```

Init repo

In our example we want to configure for CyanogenMod 12.0

```
$ mkdir -p ~/android/cm12/
$ cd ~/android/cm12/
$ repo init -u https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android.git -b cm-12.0
```

You may also repo init AOSP https://android.googlesource.com/...

There is a GitHub mirror (not always up-to-date) of AOSP at
<https://github.com/android>

### Syncing the source code

<!-- Start: 2015-04-10 20:53 CEST -->

    $ repo sync â€“j16

(and a lot of waiting)

<!-- End: 2015-04-10 22:45 CEST -->

Result:
