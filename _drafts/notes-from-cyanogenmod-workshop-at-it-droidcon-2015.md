# Notes from CyanogenMod Workshop at IT Droidcon 2015

Here are a few notes which I took when attending the
[Cyanogen Workshop](http://it.droidcon.com/2015/sessions/cyanogen-workshop/)
during the [IT Droidcon 2015](http://it.droidcon.com/2015/) which took place in Torino on 2015-04-10.

The workshop was led by [Abhisek Devkota](https://twitter.com/ciwrl), Senior Engineering and Community Manager at Cyanogen Inc., who was extremely good in driving the workshop forward and answered a lot of questions from the audience.
